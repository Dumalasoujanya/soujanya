<p>Designing is one of many tasks for digital printing. You must focus on the fab
ric you choose for print. It should be of high quality so that the colors you added to your design appear similarly. Before using any fabric, you must wash and dry it properly.
 It is better to take a test print. This way, you can check whether the pattern appears the same as you designed. The fabric color also matters a lot because the design </p>

<p class="col">. Draw a subtly curved vertical line in one continuous movement. Don't worry about how straight or how curved the line is, just free-hand a vertical line. This will serve as your vertical balance line.
Traditionally, a vertical balance line is a straight line that determines figure balance and foot placement. To make it a bit easier, we are bending the rules and making this line semi-curved. This semi-curved line will still allow you to draw the correct balance in your fashion figure but it will also help you capture the figure's movement much easier, especially if you are a beginner.

<p class="col"> On the first dash from the top draw another horizontal slanted line in the opposite direction to the hip line. This will serve as the shoulder line.

   Just as you did for the hip line, don't worry about the measurement of the shoulder line. Free hand it in one continuous line ensuring that it slants in the opposite direction to the hip line.

 <p class="col">Now for the connect the dots portion: You will connect the shoulders to the waist, the waist to the hips and the hips to the bottom center dash on both side of the figure. This will complete a rough draft of the torso and you will finally start to see your fashion figure emerge from all the lines.
   The shoulder should always be slightly wider than the hips. It is up to you how wide you want to make it as long as you keep this proportion in mind.
-The waist can be as thin or as wide as you wish. For a more dramatic fashion drawing, you can make the waist very thin.</p>

<p class="col">The horizontal line will serve as the guide for eye placement. Draw the eyes right on top of this line, making sure to follow the line's curved characteristic. The horizontal curved line ensures that the eyes are moving correctly with the rest of the head/face. If you were to draw the eyes in a horizontal straight line orientation, the proportions would be off due to the fact that the eyes do not follow the 3-dimensional movement of the head. </p>

<p class="col">​Dressing the fashion figure is undeniably the most fun part- this is where you can really let those brilliant design ideas come to life.  
   ​Use the movement of your fashion figure to draw the correct fabric drape. Once you have the fashion figure drawn, this is easy to do by following the hip and shoulder placement. Make the waistline of your garment a bit curved to create more 3-dimensional movement. This is especially relevant if you are drawing a high waist skirt or pants. Curve the waist just slightly, with the curve  opening up, to make sure that the cylindrical shape of the waist is displayed in your sketch</p>
